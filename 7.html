Since the 18th century, tabla has been the principal percussion instrument in Hindustani classical music,where it may be played solo, as accompaniment with other instruments and vocals, and as a part of larger ensembles. Tabla is also frequently played in popular and folk music performances in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.The tabla is also an important instrument in the bhakti devotional traditions of Hinduism and Sikhism, such as during bhajan and kirtan singing.It is one of the main qawali instrument used by Sufi musicians.Tabla also features in dance performances such as Kathak.[9]</p></h4>
